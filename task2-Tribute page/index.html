          <h2>J.K Rowling</h2>
          <p>
            <b>Joanne Rowling also known by her pen name J. K. Rowling, is a British author
              and philanthropist. She wrote Harry Potter, a seven-volume children's fantasy
              series published from 1997 to 2007. The series has sold over 600 million
              copies, been translated into 84 languages, and spawned a global media 
              franchise including films and video games. The Casual Vacancy (2012) was
              her first novel for adults. She writes Cormoran Strike, an ongoing crime
              fiction series, under the alias Robert Galbraith.

              Born in Yate, Gloucestershire, Rowling was working as a researcher and
              bilingual secretary for Amnesty International in 1990 when she conceived 
              the idea for the Harry Potter series while on a delayed train from 
              Manchester to London. 

              Rowling concluded the Harry Potter series with Harry Potter and the Deathly
              Hallows (2007). The novels follow a boy called Harry Potter as he attends 
              Hogwarts, a school for wizards, and battles Lord Voldemort. Death and the 
              divide between good and evil are the central themes of the series. Its 
              influences include Bildungsroman (the coming-of-age genre), school stories, 
              fairy tales, and Christian allegory. 

              Rowling has won many accolades for her work. She has received an OBE and 
              made a Companion of Honour for services to literature and philanthropy. 
              Harry Potter brought her wealth and recognition, which she has used to 
              advance philanthropic endeavours and political causes. She co-founded the 
              charity Lumos and established the Volant Charitable Trust, named after her 
              mother. Rowling's charitable giving centres on medical causes and supporting
              at-risk women and children.
